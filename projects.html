													After my thesis I was recruited to continue my research with a small team at Ontario Tech University, funded by the Government of Canada. As planned, the game I developed for my thesis was adopted into a larger suite of games for elderly individuals with dementia as part of this project.
													I worked as the lead game designer and developer for the team where we worked to create a handwashing simulator and an educational game about vaccines. I created the games in Unity, and used a Leap Motion Controller 2 for the hand-tracking on the desktop version of the handwashing game.
													While working on this project I had the pleasure of getting feedback directly from our target audience through volunteer studies, and used the feedback to iterate upon the game's design numerous times. This project is currently still in development.

													The video above and the screenshots below display the contributions I have made to the project as of December 2024. This includes the assembly of the basic environment, implementation of hand-tracking for the desktop version via the Leap Motion Controller 2, waterfall shader, hand painting/cleaning system, guiding hands, blacklight, and the 2D vaccine education game.
													This was my most recent project and the work I am most proud of.

														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/handwashing_guide.jpg" alt="" /></span> A transparent set of hands guide the player through each step. The gold debug spheres show which spheres must be touched by the opposite hand in order to complete the step. </div>
														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/handwashing_water.jpg" alt="" /></span> A compute shader fed by a render texture output from a well-positioned camera helps create the effect that the waterfall is being obstructed by the hands dynamically. </div>

														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/handwashing_blacklight.jpg" alt="" /> The blacklight helps to highlight any remaining dirt left on the hands. </span></div>
														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2D_vaccine_education.jpg" alt="" /> In the more complex version of the vaccine education game, players start by fighting against antigens with randomly chosen antibodies. </span> </div>
														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2D_vaccine_education_3.jpg" alt="" /> The game remembers which antibodies are effective against which antigens as you test them out. </span></div>

														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2D_vaccine_education_4.jpg" alt="" /> After each round the player is asked if they want to answer a multiple choice question relating to the flu vaccine. </span></div>
														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2D_vaccine_education_5.jpg" alt="" /> Once the player gives their answer they are told if they got the question correct and are given some extra information. </span></div>
														<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2D_vaccine_education_2.jpg" alt="" /> If they answered correctly they are provided with a vaccine that reveals all antigens weak to a specific color of antibody. </span></div>

													My thesis investigates the usability, task load, cooperative performance, and social presence effects of an asymmetric VR game for upper limb activity in the context of elderly care from the perspective of caregivers.
												</p> <p> The study presented participants with three different play modes: Cooperative within immersive VR, cooperative external to VR, and single-player within VR. The results indicate that the three conditions had above-average usability and social presence and a task load score lower than that of average daily activities. Additionally, a Sign test between the cooperative versions revealed a statistically significant difference in mean Behavioural Engagement scores favouring the version external to VR, p = 0.031. Although future studies with larger sample sizes are needed for an effective evaluation, these results indicate the exergame shows much promise in providing a highly usable, low cognitive load, socially involved exergame for people with dementia and their caregivers. </p> <p>

												<p>
													Whilst working on my thesis I took on a side project where I was funded by Meat and Poultry Canada to improve and add additional content to a VR Butcher's Simulator previously developed at Ontario Tech University.
													During this project I fixed numerous bugs, added haptic feedback, and added a new level to the game where you are tasked with carving a whole chicken.
													Below are some short videos showing the simulation and some of the content I added.
